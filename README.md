## Info

This script is used to mass export gps data from a GoPro video.
It will automatically search the `videos/` directory for all `\*.MP4` files
and export the GPS data to a file in the directory provided by the user.

## Requirements

The script expects the gpx2video project to be built in gpx2video/build/.
Instructions to do so can be found at the [gpx2video page](https://github.com/progweb/gpx2video).
